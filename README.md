# Live-Bus-Tracker-App
This app tracks a specific bus line in Boston, MA. Every 15 seconds you get an updated location of the buses. If you want to use this app, first you'd have to sign up for Google Maps API, get a unique key for you then add it in the proper section of the index.html file. 


## Running & Installation

Download all files.
Copy paste your unique google maps API key.
Open with live server!

## Road Map of Future Improvements

In the future I would like for the user to be able to click on a bus marker and have the map center around it and continuously update and follow it.
